## General Notes

Three questions
* Do we have the data and can we technically perform the analysis
* Is there a benefit to performing the analysis 
* Can the business take action on the results

How do I break the problem down (define)  
How do I build the hypothesis (define)  
What do I need to perform the analysis (produce)  
How can we tailor the output to deliver relevant insights to our clients (consume)  

Understand the client issue in context
* Current state - What are the current issues?
* Question - What needs to change; What are looking to evaluate
* Strategies might include - Process walk throughs; Client interviews; What works well? What doesn’t work well?

Approach
1. Data exploration through data visualization
2. Generate some hypotheses
3. Test the hypotheses
4. Second iteration of 2,3
5. Which hypotheses are most relevant to the exam question
6. What is the best way to visualize those hypotheses
7. What is the best way to tie these together into a story and recommendation

Target audience
* Who are they
* What are they interested in
* What level of detail do they require
* Do they favour detailed analyses or visual dashboards


## Checklist - Data Request


### Checklist

Request data that is appropriately historical

Request data that is appropriately granular

What master data will you need

Are you going to be joining data from different sources? Foreign keys/transaction ids



### Actions

Provide a succinct summary of your intended analysis

Request a sample extract prior to the full extract

Organise pre- and post-acquisition meetings



### Roadblocks

“We can’t get the data out” – potentially speaking to the wrong person



## Checklist - Analytics or Reporting Scope

## Checklist - Visualisation Evaluation

### Gestalt

Similarity, proximity and enclosure: graphical elements with shared visual properties will be considered in the same group. What groupings have been made? Are these the desired groupings?

### Tufte

Use graphics: Can a picture or graphic communicate a concept more clearly than text?

Avoid chart-junk / utilize data-ink: Does any ink not contribute to understanding?

Use labels: Could a label improve clarity, readability or differentiation?

### Design Principles

Emphasis: Where is the eye drawn? Is this where I want attention paid?

Colour: Can I use a better colour scheme?

### Pre-attentive attributes

Quantitative: Only position and length can be used to perceive quantitative data with precision.

### Business Principles

Understand narrative: Is my reader going to ask “so what”? What is the problem they are trying to solve?

### User Interface

How is the user going to view this? What screen will they use?
